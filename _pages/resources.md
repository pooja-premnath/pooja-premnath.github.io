# Computer Science and Engineering - Bachelor's Theory Coursework

These are the courses I completed during my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Engineering with Honors in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. 

Each semester, I would write notes to help myself understand the material better, and so that I wouldn't stare at my laptop screen too much.  
Now that I have finished my undergrad, I thought of putting them together here in case they might be helpful to others.  

I have notes for most subjects, but there are a few where I put in some extra effort - either because:  
- The subject was difficult and needed more focus, or  
- I found the subject interesting and wanted to study it more carefully.

The subjects where I ended up making especially detailed notes are:

1. [**Digital Principles and System Design**](https://github.com/pooja-premnath/Computer-Science-and-Engineering-Bachelors-Theory-Coursework/tree/main/Semester%203/UCS2301%20Digital%20Principles%20and%20System%20Design){:target="_blank"} (especially Synchronous and Asynchronous System Design, and Programmable Logic)
2. [**Database Management Systems**](https://github.com/pooja-premnath/Computer-Science-and-Engineering-Bachelors-Theory-Coursework/tree/main/Semester%204/UCS2404%20Database%20Management%20Systems){:target="_blank"} (particularly RDBMS Design and Transaction Processing)
3. [**Microprocessors, Microcontrollers, and Interfacing**](https://github.com/pooja-premnath/Computer-Science-and-Engineering-Bachelors-Theory-Coursework/tree/main/Semester%205/UCS2502%20Microprocessors%2C%20Microcontrollers%20and%20Interfacing){:target="_blank"} (this was a tough class- tried to become proficient in 8086 programming, so lots of examples there)
4. [**Image Processing and Analysis**](https://github.com/pooja-premnath/Computer-Science-and-Engineering-Bachelors-Theory-Coursework/tree/main/Semester%205/UCS2523%20Image%20Processing%20and%20Analysis-Elective){:target="_blank"} (the textbook was too fat to learn from, also added lots of practice problems)
5. [**Mathematics for Machine Learning - Honors**](https://github.com/pooja-premnath/Computer-Science-and-Engineering-Bachelors-Theory-Coursework/tree/main/Semester%205/UCS2H34%20Mathematics%20for%20Machine%20Learning-Honors){:target="_blank"}  (I really loved this class!)
6. **Theory of Computation** (had to practice a lot of problems, because I found the subject really hard)
7. [**Internet Programming**](https://github.com/pooja-premnath/Computer-Science-and-Engineering-Bachelors-Theory-Coursework/tree/main/Semester%206/UCS2601%20Internet%20Programming){:target="_blank"} (lots of examples on Servlets, AJAX, React, and full-stack integration in Units 3, 4 and 5)
8. [**Distributed Systems**](https://github.com/pooja-premnath/Computer-Science-and-Engineering-Bachelors-Theory-Coursework/tree/main/Semester%207/UCS2701%20Distributed%20Systems){:target="_blank"} (Liked the class and the intuitive nature of the algorithms- lots of practice examples too!)

The links point to mostly theoretical material- so courses which are programming heavy, like Data Structures, OOPs, Java etc. may not have unit-wise notes. However, wherever possible, I have also linked related lab programs, code snippets or project repositories for each subject.

If you find any errors or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I'd appreciate it! 

**UPDATE [6th May, 2025] - While opening PDFS, if there's an 'Unable to render code block' error, please download the PDF instead, using the 'Download raw file' option.**
