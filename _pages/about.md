Hi, I am Pooja! I am a senior Computer Science and Engineering (Honors) undergraduate student at SSN College of Engineering, in Chennai, India. Currently, I work as a Research Intern at the University of Alberta and the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii), with Dr. Sunil Kalmady Vasu and Dr. Russ Greiner. My research primarily focuses on clinical informatics, and healthcare data science. I am interested in building actionable, explainable multimodal systems. I also work on low-resource NLP, particularly for Indian languages, in the context of healthcare. Apart from my CS work, I love to read (mostly fantasy).

You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
